# Task Planet UI Improvements - ReactJS

## Project Overview
This project is part of an internship task where I was required to improve the UI design of two sections of the Task Planet app. I chose to work on the **Leaderboard** and **Social Media Task Design (Home Page)** sections, as per the provided instructions.

You can view the deployed version of the project on Netlify [here]([#netlify-link](https://taskplanet-uday.netlify.app)).
